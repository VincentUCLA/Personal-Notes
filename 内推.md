With a solid background in data structures, algorithms and computer science fundamentals, he is skilled in Python, Node.js, Java, Ruby, C/C++, RDBMS (mostly Postgres), several noSQL systems (Redis and MongoDB) and several web development frameworks (Flask, Express, Ruby on Rails). His skills will be suitable for our general Software Engineering positions, backend developing positions and full-stack developing positions

Through several start-up experiences, he has acquired a result-oriented mindset and skillset, including agile SDLC, fast-prototyping, long-term (3 mo) project planning and management. His results-driven work ethic and skills had brought in sizeable profits for AxleHire in his projects. Moreover, he is a true teammate with strong communication skills, since he is not only independently responsible for a vital part of AxleHire (route planning), but also working closely with his teammates to optimize the results. I believe he will become a vital part of our team, and a valuable asset to our company.
